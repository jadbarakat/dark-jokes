# Laugh Hub

Mobile app made with React Native to surface [Sv443's JokeAPI](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/)'s collection of jokes.

Features:

- Get a joke
- Filter jokes by category
- Share joke using device native share functionality
- Add joke to favourites
- Sort favourites by date added ascending or descending
- Supports light and dark modes
- Change app tint color with one tap
- "Minimal mode"
- Easter egg ðŸ¥š - just open the Favourites screen and tap on the title 5 times to reveal a Playground screen ðŸ™‚

Interesting dependencies:

- [expo](https://docs.expo.dev/)
- [react-navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
- [jotai](https://jotai.org/)
- [gorhom/bottom-sheet](https://gorhom.github.io/react-native-bottom-sheet/)
- [react-native-toast-message](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-toast-message)

Things that are next on my to-do list:

- Add theme event listener so changes to device theme affects the app as well
- ~~Make the blacklist filter preferences persist through sessions~~

Please note this is a project I worked on as a hobby to practice my development skills - still honing them ðŸ˜€
